### Motivation:
Homelessness is an continued issue which burdenâ€™s our community across the globe, specially elevated with COVID. Goal of the project is to dive into factors that are related to homeleness and housing prices using various data available to us nationwide.

### Project Description/Outline:
* Relationship between real estate prices and homeless population.
* If there is correlation, which county has the highest homeless population or most expensive housing? 
* Which is the most feasible real estate locations. (Less homeless, affordable housing).

### Research Questions to Answer:
* Is there any correlation between real estate prices and homeless population 
* Which cities/county has the highest homeless population? 
* Homeless shelters, view, geographics 
* Demographic Bar graph : homeless population demographics
